# Ascent
 Ascent Engine - Creating a small engine in cpp with OpenGL.

# Goals
This project is for learning purposes only right now.
After the "Unity Crisis", I  was confused between leaving Unity and moving to Godot/Unreal, stay, or try something news.
I decided to not be "hard linked" to any kind of other proprietary engine for now, and dive back in to the core of the rendering. 
Parallel to this project I'll take a look at some others tools (Houdini/Substance to name a few)

# Target 
- 3D Scene View
- OBJ File Loading
- Shaders loading and editing support
- Basic interface with DearIMGUI
- Basic Transform System

# Done
- Basic Window Setup
- Standard Vertex and Fragment Shader Support.
